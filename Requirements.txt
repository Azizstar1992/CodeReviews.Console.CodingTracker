1. show the data on the console, you should use the "Spectre.Console" library.


2.You're required to have separate classes in different files (ex. UserInput.cs, Validation.cs, CodingController.cs)


3.User should be told the specific format that date and time needs to be logged, exclude all other.

4.You'll need to create a configuration file that you'll contain your database path and connection strings.

5.CodingSession class needed, its got  the properties of your coding session: Id, StartTime, EndTime, Duration

6. The user shouldn't input the duration of the session. It should be calculated based on the Start and End times, in a separate "CalculateDuration" method.

7. The user should be able to input the start and end times manually.

8.You need to use Dapper ORM for the data access instead of ADO.NET. (This requirement was included in Feb/2024)

9.When reading from the database, you can't use an anonymous object, you have to read your table into a List of Coding Sessions.
